# ðŸ‘‹ About Me â€” Casey

**Network Operations Technician 2 | Christian Radio Broadcasting | Ministry Volunteer**

Powered by faith and fueled by strong coffee, I work as a Network Operations Technician with a Christian Radio Station, where I help transmit positive and encouraging music to all who want to know and pursue God. Every day, I get to combine my technical skills with my passion for sharing hope through reliable broadcast operations.

## What I Do
- **Radio Broadcasting**: Ensuring seamless transmission of Christian music and content that encourages listeners in their faith journey
- **Network Operations**: Managing critical infrastructure that keeps our message on the air 24/7
- **Ministry Service**: Volunteering with Experience Community Church's Parking Team, 5000 Ministry, and Reclaimed Ministry

## My Mission
I strive to be a light for Jesus in everything I doâ€”whether I'm troubleshooting network issues, serving at church, or connecting with others in the community. My goal is simple: use my technical skills and volunteer work to do good for others and point them toward God's love.

## Beyond the Technical
When I'm not ensuring our radio signals reach every corner of our community, you'll find me:
- Serving with the Parking Team at Experience Community Church
- Volunteering with 5000 Ministry and Reclaimed Ministry
- Continuously learning new technologies to better serve our mission
- Building connections with fellow believers and tech enthusiasts

## Let's Connect
Whether you're interested in Christian radio, network operations, or finding ways to use technology for ministry, I'd love to connect. I believe in the power of collaboration and communityâ€”especially when it's centered on serving others.

**"Whatever you do, work at it with all your heart, as working for the Lord." â€” Colossians 3:23**
