# ðŸ‘‹ About Me â€” Casey
Powered by coffee so strong it could wake a quantum computer, fueled by faith, and coded in Python (with a sneaky dash of JavaScript because Iâ€™m extra like that).

Network Operations Technician @ K-LOVE | Quantum Computing Daydreamer | Volunteer Chaos Coordinator

Iâ€™m here to networkâ€”whether itâ€™s Wi-Fi signals or new friendsâ€”while debugging lifeâ€™s messiest bugs one laugh at a time. When Iâ€™m not wrestling rogue routers or pondering if SchrÃ¶dingerâ€™s cat has Wi-Fi, Iâ€™m out volunteering with Reclaimed Ministry, People Loving Nashville, or The 5000 (feeding souls and stomachs, no admin password required).
Cybersecurity keeps me paranoid, quantum computing keeps me curious, and content creation keeps me caffeinated. Current obsession? Tinkering with Python scripts to simulate quantum shenanigansâ€”because who doesnâ€™t want to collapse a wavefunction before breakfast? Letâ€™s collab on something epicâ€”bring your own coffee, your wildest ideas, or just a meme about JavaScript closures. I promise not to byteâ€”unless youâ€™re a mosquito at a summer BBQ or a glitch in my code!
