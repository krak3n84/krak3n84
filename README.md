# ðŸ‘‹ About Me â€” Casey

Welcome! I'm Casey, a Network Operations Technician with K-LOVE Christian Ministry, passionate about technology, faith-driven service, and lifelong learning.

I enjoy exploring Cybersecurity, Quantum Computing, Python programming, and content creationâ€”always looking for new ways to use technology positively. My heart is rooted in serving others through volunteering with Greenhouse Ministries, The Journey Home, Reclaimed Ministry and The 5000 at Church.

Feel free to connect, collaborate, or just say hi! I believe we're better togetherâ€”let's make something impactful.

**"Whatever you do, work at it with all your heart, as working for the Lord." â€” Colossians 3:23**
